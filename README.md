# itself

Ever wondered what happens if you commit the `.git` folder itself? Well, this.

## How this works
We can't hard-link directories and git can handle symbolic links properly.
However what we __can__ do is move `.git` to a similarly-named folder
and symlink the actual `.git` to that.

Also, you probably noticed, but that's not an actual i.
